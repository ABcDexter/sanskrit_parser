# How to write the sandhi rules
#------------------------------
# Lines beginning with a # or empty lines are skipped
# Each line should contain one rule written in devanagari 
# (easier to read/check for a human)
# Each rule is typically left_1 + left_2 = right_1 / right_2 / ...
# left_1 and left_2 can specify lists. These will be 
# expanded by the parser to generate a product of all possible combinations
# E.g. [अ, इ, उ, ऋ][ ङ्, ञ्, न्] + [अ, आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, ऋ, ॠ, ए, ऐ, ओ, औ]
# right uses Python's format string specification to refer to
# elements from the left expression. 
# Note that even a single character on the left is treated as a list, so be 
# careful with indexing in the right expression.
# E.g. एचोऽयवायावः / यान्तवान्तादेशः would be specified as 
# ए + [आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, ऋ, ॠ, ऌ, ए, ऐ, ओ, औ] = अय्{1} (the ए would be considered as list 0)
# Multiple right expressions can be specified by separating them with "/"
# Spaces at the beginning and end of expressions are stripped,
# but if they appear inside an expression, they will be preserved
# E.g. the space in अ {1}  for एचोऽयवायावः + लोपः शाकल्यस्य will be retained


# ङमुडागमः
[अ, इ, उ, ऋ][ ङ्, ञ्, न्] + [अ, आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, ऋ, ॠ, ए, ऐ, ओ, औ] = {0}{1}{1}{2}
